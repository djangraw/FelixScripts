This repo contains all scripts in Felix directory /data/jangrawdc, and is automatically updated every night.

While a nightly update is not common practice for a shared repo, this system provides the coder with a backup of scripts and a record of changes, allowing them to revert to earlier versions of a script if necessary.

To set up your own auto-updating repo, follow the instructions in the header of SetAutoUpdate.sh, then run it. Happy coding!
