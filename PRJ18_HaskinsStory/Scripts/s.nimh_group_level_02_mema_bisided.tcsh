# Script: s.nimh_group_level_02_mema_bisided.tcsh
# Run on: openfmri/ds001_R2.0.4
# Date  : May, 2018
#
# Take a group of subjects processed for task-based FMRI, run 3dMEMA
# on their final statistical results.  Clustering is also performed
# here, using 3dClustSim (with the ACF blur estimation).  Some
# individual volumes of t-statistics and effect estimate maps are also
# output.  This provides an example of using the newest clusterizing
# program in AFNI, 3dClusterize (an update version of 3dclust).
#
# Used as an example of proper two-sided testing in:
#
#   A tail of two sides: Artificially doubled false positive rates in
#   neuroimaging due to the sidedness choice with t-tests

#
#   NOTE: The processing described in "Some comments..." includes sets
#   of processing commands correcting/improving upon some sets of
#   commands run in an earlier study by a different group (see therein
#   for more details).  However, even the "NIMH" set of commands still
#   includes some non-ideal features, as described there, for the
#   purposes of comparison with the other group's processing stream.
#   Please read the associated text carefully before using/adapting
#   those scripts.

# To run for a single subject, for example:
#
#   tcsh -ef s.nimh_group_level_02_mema_bisided.tcsh
#
# On a cluster you might want to use scratch disk space for faster
# writing, and a lot of memory and CPUs, depending on the
# data/processing choices.  Syntax might be:
#
#   sbatch                       \
#      --partition=SOME_NAMES    \
#      --cpus-per-task=32        \
#      --mem=64g                 \

# Run the 'clusterize' program to make maps of the clusters (sorted by

# should report.
#
# The main inputs are: dataset contain the statistic volume to be
# thresholded, a mask within which to find clusters, and the ClustSim
# parameters+outputs.  A common addition to this list of inputs is to
# specify the location of the EE volume in the input dset, for
# reporting the EE info within any found clusters.

#      -idat       :(opt) str label EE vol in inset; or, use vol index: 0
#      -mask       :same mask input to 3dClustSim (here, whole brain)
#      -bisided    :specify *type* of test; followed by threshold limit info
